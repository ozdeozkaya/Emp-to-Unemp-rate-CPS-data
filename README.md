# CPS


## Overwiev

The goal is to help to extract raw CPS files and link different records from different months. 

You can download public raw CPS files from this link: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.2018.html

Each file here is in .dat format. 

Alternatively, you can download the CPS data from https://cps.ipums.org/cps/ for different programs -- which should be easier than reading raw data as we do here.
